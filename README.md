## Description 
A simple sample plugin demonstrating some of the ways a plugin can place dependencies on other plugins.
This plugin is dependent upon the oik base plugin - for plugin update functionality
and the bbbboing plugin- for no reason at all.

In v1.2.1 we've added a composer.json file
in order to learn how composer does its stuff.

The result of these tests will enable us to determine the 'right way'
to use composer to help implement 'shareable shared libraries'.

The first stage is to have a plugin that contains a composer.json file in the first place.




## Installation 
1. Upload the contents of the bobbing plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/bobbing' directory
1. Activate the bobbing plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
